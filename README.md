# 💯 100 Weeks of Code

**100 Weeks of Code** is a long-term Python journey where we create **one project every week**—starting from basic tools and utilities, gradually moving into complex domains like **machine learning**, **game development**, **GUI programming**, and even **AI music generation**.

Every 10 weeks, projects will be integrated to build something larger and more meaningful using the skills learned in those weeks. The grand finale? A full-fledged **intelligent assistant** powered by everything we've learned.

## 📌 Purpose

The aim of this challenge is to **sharpen programming skills**, develop consistency, and explore various fields in computer science with hands-on experience.

Focus areas include:

- ✅ Core Python
- ✅ Math & logic-based programming
- ✅ GUIs
- ✅ APIs & databases
- ✅ AI and ML
- ✅ Full-stack application logic

## 🚀 Week 1 - Area & Perimeter Calculator (for Complex Geometric Shapes)

This week’s project is a **geometry calculator** that computes **area** and **perimeter** for the following shapes:

- Circle
- Rectangle
- Square
- Triangle
- Parallelogram
- Trapezium

### 🔧 Features

- Takes user input via the terminal.
- Uses `math.pi` for precise circle calculations.
- Cleanly structured with helper functions for each shape.
- Handles invalid inputs with graceful error messages.

### 📂 File

- `Week_1.py` — the main script.

### ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then:

```bash
run Week1\dist\Week1.exe
